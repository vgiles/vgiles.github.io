This thing was inspired by the salad with the same title that Disco
Beans in Preston (Melb, Vic) have on their menu at the moment. I am
seriously considering doing their cooking class to learn how to make at
least the dressing that comes with it. But I thought this would be a
pretty tasty lunch on a fairly warm day.

My partner thinks it was too fatty tasting and too strong on the olive
oil, but I disagree on both counts. However, if you decide to make it,
keep that in mind. In future, I would add some seaweed and avocado, and
possibly a sprinkling of crushed chilli on top.

Revision two modifies the dressing a little, and includes avocado and
alternative leafy greens.

### Salad Ingredients

You could use whatever you want, really. But I used:

-   5-10 cherry tomatoes, quartered.
-   The entirety of the inner heart of an iceberg lettuce, loosely
    chopped OR;
-   Two big handfuls of mixed greens, OR;
-   Two big handfuls of baby spinach
-   1/2 a lebanese cucumber, cut lengthways into small lengths.
-   1/2 a zucchini grated
-   1 bunch (about 8-9) spring onions, chopped
-   1 large avocado, cubed
-   1 tube of Chinese buckwheat soba noodles (dried, boiled for five
    minutes, strained, washed with cold water, and left to cool). These
    have wheat in them.

### Dressing

-   1/3 cup of extra virgin olive oil
-   1 tbsp of sesame oil
-   1 tbsp of black sesame seeds
-   1/3 cup of soy sauce
-   1 heaped tsp of white miso paste (optional)
-   1 tsp of vegan "fish" sauce (made with pineapple juice)
-   2 basically juiceless limes, but would use 1 juicy one.
-   1 tbsp lemon juice
-   1/3 cup of rice wine vinegar
-   1 tbsp of tepid, brewed, black tea.

Whisk that all together, assemble salad and toss, pour on the dressing,
toss again (I used hands!) and serve.

Needs revision, but it was really good.
