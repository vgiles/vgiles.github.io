Tofu & Marinated Tempeh BBQ Shish + Salad
=========================================

Yes, yes, it's summer. Yes, I generally hate it. Alice and I bought a
barbecue though, so that's changed how I think about cooking over the
last... two days.

I have to say, this was freaking delicious.

### Ingredients (for the shish)

-   \~1 slab of tempeh, cubed
-   \~1/2 pack of sesame tofu that you can buy at the supermarket. The
    other 1/2 was used yesterday.
-   \~Raw peanuts, crushed with mortar and pestle (a couple of good
    handfuls)
-   \~4 tbsp pure peanut butter (for Australians, Coles now sell this in
    1kg tubs - no salt, sugar, or oil. Just ground up peanuts. Lots of
    health food shops sell it too)
-   \~Good drizzle of Kecap Manis (sweet Indonesian soy sauce)
-   \~1 tsp of ground turmeric
-   \~2 tsp of Za\`atar (middle eastern spice mix)
-   \~1 clove of garlic, crushed
-   \~2 red birds-eye chilis finely chopped

### Method (for the shish)

1.  Ignore the tofu.
2.  Mix all the ingredients in a bowl, give it a good old stir, taste
    and adjust accordingly, then put the cubed tempeh in it, give it all
    a good stir to coat.
3.  Cover and put in the fridge for at least three hours.
4.  Remove tempeh (and tofu) from fridge.
5.  Obtain skewers
6.  Wet said skewers under a tap.
7.  Alternate threading tofu-tempeh-tofu-tempeh-tofu, etc, until desired
    amount of soy goodness is on each skewer.
8.  BBQ on high for a few minutes to crisp, then on low to cook. Turn
    constantly. If your BBQ has a hood, you can use that to cook it
    through more quickly on low.

### Ingredients (for salad dressing)

-   \~1.5 tsp of pomegranate molasses
-   \~2-3 tbsp of balsamic vinegar
-   \~1/2 a lime worth of lime juice

### Method (for the salad)

Whisk these together to form a tangy but sweet vinegar dressing. Drizzle
on salad with a decent quantity of olive oil and a pinch of salt.

#### Salad suggestion

-   Sliced pear
-   Finely chopped coriander
-   Roquette
-   Baby spinach
-   Cherry tomatoes
-   Baby yellow roma tomatoes
-   White onion
-   1-2 birds-eye chilis chopped
-   Chopped avocado
