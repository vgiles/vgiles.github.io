I made some peanut butter. It's okay.
-------------------------------------

And an additional recipe to go along with the custard tart recipe.

### Ingredients

Salted, roasted peanuts x whatever quantity.

\~2-3 tbsp chia seed

Olive oil as necessary

### Method

Blend ingredients until a paste is made, and assess the oily-ness, add
more oil as you feel necessary.

Tasty.
