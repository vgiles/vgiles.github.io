I teach music making across the following disciplines, many of which are interrelated.

* Music composition: 
    * Notated music;
    * Semi-notated/structural improvisation;
    * Electronic music;
    * Hybrid acoustic/electronic music;
    * Experimental music practices;
    * Acousmatic/electroacoustic music;
* Music theory*: 
    * 20th/21st Century Music theory: 
        * 12-tone technique;
        * total serialism;
        * set theory;
    * Counterpoint;
* Electronic music tools: 
    * MaxMSP;
    * PureData;
    * Ableton Live;
* Improvisation;
* Academic writing: 
    * Essays;
    * Editing;
    * Structural logic.
* NB: Music theory is taught through composition activities.

Within reason I will come to you in the following parts of Melbourne:

* Brunswick/Brunswick East/Brunswick West/Coburg;
* Northcote/Thornbury;
* Heidelberg/Rosanna/Ivanhoe;
* Melbourne CBD and surrounds.

You can read about my [work][1], and my [qualifications and experiences][2] elsewhere on my website, but in short I hold a PhD from the University of Melbourne, in sonic practice across music and installation, along with a Bachelor of Music with first class Honours from Monash University. I am an internationally-performed composer and former professional bassist.

These music lessons are a _minimum_ of one hour in duration, charged in 15-minute blocks after the first hour.

Please [contact me][3] for additional information or to book a lesson.
