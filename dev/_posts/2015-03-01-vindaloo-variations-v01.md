I went out for dinner last night with my partner and some old school
friends (and SOs) to an Indian restaurant in Melbourne called Gaylords.
It was exquisite, though I somehow ended up with an *extra-*hot
vegetarian Vindaloo. It didn't list that it included paneer, which was
annoying, but it did, so it was not vegan. But it was exquisite. It
inspired me to make a vindaloo of my own. I've used other people's
recipes, or book recipes, for years now, but I've not tackled a vegan
vindaloo yet. To be fair, I'm not entirely convinced it should be called
a vindaloo, though of course there is so much variety in these curries
that it probably doesn't matter. Anywayâ€¦ for the base of this recipe I
used Madhur Jaffrey's Goan Pork Vindaloo recipe (from her *Quick & Easy
Indian Cooking,* which is written for a pressure cooker, which I don't
have!)

I've not tried the original recipe, but it served as a decent basis to
build mine off. So I want to acknowledge that source material.

This recipe also differs from, as far as I can tell, a lot of Indian
cooking because it is baked in a cast-iron pot (pot-roasted?) rather
than cooked on a stove, or a pressure cooker. Also note that this is a
recipe designed for bulk cooking so that my partner and I can take food
to work with us over the coming days.

### General ingredients:

1x large potato + 2x medium potatoes, loosely cubed in various sizes

550g firm tofu, cubed

\~2-3 cups of (soaked/cooked) chickpeas. I used dried, which soaked for
about 12 hours.

Couple of handfuls of green beans, with ends removed.

1 tin of whole tomatoes

1 tin of coconut milk

1-2 tbsp of coconut oil

### Curry paste ingredients & method:

-   1.5 tbsp brown mustard seeds
-   1.5 tbsp yellow mustard seeds
-   3 tbsp apple cider vinegar + more as needed (I used white as I ran
    out of AC)

1. Using a large mortar and pestle, grind the mustard seeds and
vinegar into a paste that still has quite a bit of texture.

To this paste, add:

\~12 large cloves of garlic

\~1 medium red onions, loosely chopped

3 heaped tsp of ground turmeric

3 heaped tsp of ground coriander seed

3 heaped tsp of ground cumin seed

3 heaped tsp of cayenne pepper

3 dried kashmiri chilis

\~1 tsp of asafoetida powder

2 level tsp of salt

\~9-15 dried curry leaves

\~3 tbsp of red wine vinegar

2. Pulverise until a chunky paste consistency is achieved.

### Method:

-   Preheat oven to 160C (fan forced), with large cast-iron pot (with
    lid) inside
-   In a separate frying pan, heat on a hot heat the coconut oil.
-   Once hot, add about 1/3 of the curry paste and fry until fragrant
-   Add the cubed tofu and fry until it starts to absorb the colour of
    the paste


-   Remove hot pot from oven, transfer contents from frying pan to pot
-   Add the remaining paste and fresh ingredients
-   Add tomatoes including juice, then use scissors to chop them up
-   Add coconut milk and about 1/2 a tin of extra water
-   Put the lid on and put it in the oven for about an hour and a half,
    stirring every 30 or so minutes.
-   Once the hour and a half is up (or the potatoes/chickpeas are nearly
    cooked through), turn the oven up to 200C (fan-forced) and cook for
    a further 30-40 minutes until well-reduced and a thick, clinging
    gravy exists and the tomatoes have basically turned to liquid. Sauce
    should be a dark caramel colour by this stage.
-   Serve with basmati rice or whatever you want.
