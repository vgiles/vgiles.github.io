I went out for dinner last night with my partner and some old school friends (and SOs) to an Indian restaurant in Melbourne called Gaylords. It was exquisite, though I somehow ended up with an <i>extra-</i>hot vegetarian Vindaloo. It didn't list that it included paneer, which was annoying, but it did, so it was not vegan. But it was exquisite. It inspired me to make a vindaloo of my own. I've used other people's recipes, or book recipes, for years now, but I've not tackled a vegan vindaloo yet. To be fair, I'm not entirely convinced it should be called a vindaloo, though of course there is so much variety in these curries that it probably doesn't matter. Anywayâ€¦ for the base of this recipe I used Madhur Jaffrey's Goan Pork Vindaloo recipe (from her <i>Quick &amp; Easy Indian Cooking, </i>which is written for a pressure cooker, which I don't have!)
</p>
<p>
I've not tried the original recipe, but it served as a decent basis to build mine off. So I want to acknowledge that source material.
</p>

<p>
This recipe also differs from, as far as I can tell, a lot of Indian cooking because it is baked in a cast-iron pot (pot-roasted?) rather than cooked on a stove, or a pressure cooker. Also note that this is a recipe designed for bulk cooking so that my partner and I can take food to work with us over the coming days.

<h1>Variation on a Vindaloo (V. 0.1)</h1>


<h3>General ingredients:</h3>
<ul>
</ul>
<li>1x large potato + 2x medium potatoes, loosely cubed in various sizes</li>
<li>550g firm tofu, cubed</li>
<li>~2-3 cups of (soaked/cooked) chickpeas. I used dried, which soaked for about 12 hours.</li>
<li>Couple of handfuls of green beans, with ends removed.</li>
<li>1 tin of whole tomatoes</li>
<li>1 tin of coconut milk</li>
<li>1-2 tbsp of coconut oil</li>

<h3>Curry paste ingredients &amp; method:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>1.5 tbsp brown mustard seeds</li>
  <li>1.5 tbsp yellow mustard seeds</li>
  <li>3 tbsp apple cider vinegar + more as needed (I used white as I ran out of AC)</li>
</ul>

<p>
  STEP ONE: Using a large mortar and pestle, grind the mustard seeds and vinegar into a paste that still has quite a bit of texture.
</p>
<p>
  To this paste, add:
</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<li>~12 large cloves of garlic</li>
<li>~1 medium red onions, loosely chopped</li>
<li>3 heaped tsp of ground turmeric</li>
<li>3 heaped tsp of ground coriander seed</li>
<li>3 heaped tsp of ground cumin seed</li>
<li>3 heaped tsp of cayenne pepper</li>
<li>3 dried kashmiri chilis</li>
<li>~1 tsp of asafoetida powder</li>
<li>2 level tsp of salt</li>
<li>~9-15 dried curry leaves</li>
<li>~3 tbsp of red wine vinegar</li>

<p>
  Pulverise until a chunky paste consistency is achieved.
</p>

<h3>Method:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Preheat oven to 160C (fan forced), with large cast-iron pot (with lid) inside</li>
  <li>In a separate frying pan, heat on a hot heat the coconut oil.</li>
  <li>Once hot, add about 1/3 of the curry paste and fry until fragrant</li>
  <li>Add the cubed tofu and fry until it starts to absorb the colour of the paste</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Remove hot pot from oven, transfer contents from frying pan to pot</li>
  <li>Add the remaining paste and fresh ingredients</li>
  <li>Add tomatoes including juice, then use scissors to chop them up</li>
  <li>Add coconut milk and about 1/2 a tin of extra water</li>
  <li>Put the lid on and put it in the oven for about an hour and a half, stirring every 30 or so minutes.</li>
  <li>Once the hour and a half is up (or the potatoes/chickpeas are nearly cooked through), turn the oven up to 200C (fan-forced) and cook for a further 30-40 minutes until well-reduced and a thick, clinging gravy exists and the tomatoes have basically turned to liquid. Sauce should be a dark caramel colour by this stage.</li>
  <li>Serve with basmati rice or whatever you want.</li>
</ul>
