This little recipe has been in development for a while now, and is also
the first v.1.0 recipe I've posted.

I really need to emphasise that I have borrowed most of the recipe from
[VeganEasy.org, the recipe is by
Jo.](http://www.veganeasy.org/S-Anzac-Biscuits)Â However, I have modified
it to suit my own taste and cooking style, so I am including my version
here. This version is much, much less sweet than the original, but
likely more crumbly (which I like).

-   Preheat oven to 180C (FF).
-   1 cup of oats
-   1 cup of self-raising flour, gluten free
-   1 cup of desiccated coconut (or shredded, but des. works better)
-   1/2 cup of soft brown sugar
-   2/3 cup of liquid coconut oil
-   1 tsp of warm/hot water

Combine all the ingredients in a mixing bowl and then form into biscuits
(squish into walnut sized balls, then flatten slightly), place onto a
baking-paper-lined-baking-tray, and bake at 180C for about 25 minutes or
until you think they are suitably baked.

Enjoy.
