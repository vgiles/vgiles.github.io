No photo, unfortunately, but I made this creamy salad dressing to go
with a mock-chicken salad. I suspect it would also go exceptionally well
with either pasta or potato salad.

### Ingredients

-   Tahini paste
-   Extra virgin olive oil
-   Nutritional yeast flakes
-   Salt
-   Apple cider vinegar
-   Dried marjoram

### Method

1.  In a little jar with a tight-fitting lid, add the ingredients
    roughly as follows:
2.  1:2:2 ratio between tahini:olive oil:vinegar
3.  Pinch of salt
4.  Two tsp of yeast flakes (depending on quantity of dressing)
5.  Marjoram as desired (I used about a tsp)
6.  Then put the lid on tight and shake the hell out of it until it's
    all smooth and creamy, adjusting the quantity of oil as necessary
    for more smoothness.
