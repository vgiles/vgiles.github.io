This post follows on directly from the
[former](http://vegancomposition.blogspot.com.au/2015/01/onion-eggplant-tomato-savoury-tart-v-01.html),
and was made with the remaining 0.8x pastry sheet.

### Ingredients

-   0.8x pastry sheet (if making from scratch, just be brave and use a
    whole one/make a bigger one/whatever)
-   1.5x valencia oranges
-   2x granny smith apples
-   agave/maple syrup
-   star anise
-   ground cinnamon
-   whole cloves
-   coconut oil
-   spray oil

### Method

1.  Preheat oven to 180C (fan-forced)
2.  Slice the apples into rough slices (not wedges) without the core
3.  Slice the oranges into roughly 12ths, as wedges (peel before hand if
    you like, or after)
4.  Layer the pastry in a small pie/tart dish after spraying with oil if
    you want
5.  Place 0.5-1x star anise on the pastry
6.  Layer the apple on top evenly
7.  Add a sprinkle of whole cloves (about 12)
8.  Add the oranges (skin off) in a similar layer
9.  Sprinkle ground cinnamon fairly liberally on top of the oranges
10. Drizzle agave/maple syrup (I used a mixture of the both, but you
    could use either)
11. Drizzle some coconut oil on top of that
12. Bake for about 50-60 minutes until somewhat reduced and cooked
    through.
