  Doing roasts without meat is a pretty fun challenge. The best part, I find, asides the awesome array of flavour, is the complete lack of preparation time and cleaning that is required. I remember in the periods where I've eaten meat (between not), the pre-time for roasting meat is much greater than for vegetables.

  So when doing roasts, as I did this evening, finding a fun new centrepiece or side to take the place of the roast meat really presents some fun cooking opportunities. This recipe was served with:
</p>

<ul>
<li>potatoes &amp; parsnip roasted in olive oil, garlic, onion, rosemary, and black pepper;</li>
<li>zucchini, carrots, green capsicum, roasted in canola oil, white pepper, dried oregano.</li>
</ul>

<p>
So on to the recipe.

Sorry I forgot to take a photo. It looked like it sounds like it would look.
