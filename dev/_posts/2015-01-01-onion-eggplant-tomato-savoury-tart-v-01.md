You have to start somewhere, right?

I did not really want to cook anything tonight, but got inspired by a
story about the onion (which was pretty mediocre really) on some news
website (either The Guardian or The Age), which in itself is
unremarkable, but it made me consider what I could do with the abundance
of red onions that my partner and I bought from the market the other
day.

This post will also serve as somewhat of an introduction to what this
blog is, or will be, if I manage to keep it up.

You see, I am terrible at noting down nice recipes that I come up with.
So this serves as my own personal "recipe book", if you like. But I
figure that other people might also like them. The difference – I hope –
between this and other food blogs is that I will be using this to
document the development of recipes, somewhat like the development of
music scores, from an early version (0.1) through to a finished version
(1.0), and possibly beyond. I have a suspicion that many will stay at
0.1. However! There is an opportunity here for other people to join in
the experimentation and suggest changes/etc. So I liken it to
"experimental music", where the outcome is potentially unknown (though
sometimes anticipated), and may not actually work.

So that's the idea. Now for the first recipe. Remember, this was made up
20 minutes ago, and I have no idea how it tastes.

### Ingredients

-   1.2x sheets of shortcrust pastry (vegan, in my case) \[the remaining
    0.8 will be used in another recipe\]
-   3x medium-large red onions
-   1.5x large tomatoes
-   0.5x medium-large aubergine/eggplant (split lengthways)
-   \~7 oyster mushrooms
-   Cracked black pepper
-   Ground white pepper
-   Salt
-   Asafoetida
-   Olive oil
-   Dried basil
-   About 10 dry bay leaves
-   Spray oil for tart tray (I used canola)

### Method

1.  If using frozen pastry, thaw it. Preheat oven to 180C (fan-forced).
2.  Top and tail the three onions, cut them in half, then slice them.
    Keep it reasonably rough.
3.  With the half eggplant, slice it in half length ways, repeat, and
    repeat again (for each quarter), then chop the small wedges in half
    sideways to get \~3-4cm length wedges.
4.  Spray a tart tray/shallow pie dish with oil. Lay the 1.2 sheets of
    pastry as necessary to fill the dish and neaten the edges if
    necessary/use the excess to complete the edges too.
5.  Grind some black pepper all over the pastry.
6.  Add the onions in one large layer, remember that they will reduce
    substantially with cooking.
7.  Add eggplant wedges in slightly layered circle around the outer edge
    of the onions. Sprinkle salt over the wedges, then drizzle olive oil
    on top of that.
8.  Trim the stalks off the oyster mushrooms and place them in the
    centre, and with any extra mushrooms cut them in half and place them
    every 2-3 wedges of eggplant.
9.  Chop the tomatoes in thin slices. Place on top of the wedges,
    close-ish together, and then one or two slices in the centre.
10. Cover with white pepper, basil, asafoetida, and some more olive oil,
    and wedge bay leaves in/on the top layer.
11. Place in the oven uncovered and bake for about 80 minutes, making
    sure that the eggplant is cooked (use your eyes and/or a skewer)
12. Serve with a side of rocket/roquette lettuce, with a drizzle of lime
    juice, and a few slivers of avocado. I don't roquette available
    tonight, so it will likely be a mixed-cabbage and carrot dry slaw,
    with avocado.

Slaw Side
---------

Given that my avocados were bad, and I lacked roquette, I made this slaw
in place.

### Ingredients/method

-   Red cabbage, green cabbage, carrot: all grated, not too much as it's
    a side.
-   A squeeze of lemon juice, some ground black pepper and salt, hand
    mixed and served on the side.

### Verdict

Really, really damn good.
