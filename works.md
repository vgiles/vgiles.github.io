This page contains a list of works arranged by instrumentation. If the score is not linked herein, please contact me to obtain. vin [@] vgiles.net

There are a number of works that I have not included here, either because I do not wish them to be performed, or they form part of long-term, fast-output projects. A more complete list, arranged by year, can be [found here][1] [updated August 2016], but please contact me about anything on that list that is not included on this page.
