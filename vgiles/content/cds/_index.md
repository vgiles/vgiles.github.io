[Monash University Flute Ensemble: Fantasie Australis][2] (CD)

Two of my works: _Fantasie Australis_ and _Fragments_ appear on this newly released CD from Move Records. I think this is an amazing achievement and the result is superb. It's a very fine CD and there is some great playing on it! Many thanks to Peter and the MUFE.

[Peter Sheridan: Monologues and Dialogues][3] (CD)

My composition _Differing Dialogues_ was recorded and released by low-flutes specialist, Peter Sheridan via the Move Records label here in Melbourne, in 2011. My deepest thanks to Peter for this fantastic opportunity. The CD is available from Thomas', TITLE, direct from Move and from other good CD stores including Hans Music Spot.

[ Fracture: Fracture][4] (Electronic)

The first release of my improv trio with Steve Marton and Malcolm Abbott, released for free via the Clinical Archives netlabel. A new collection of electronic-inspired music will be coming out in the next couple of months!
