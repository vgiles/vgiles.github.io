      <description>Vincent Giles » Composer &amp;amp; Sonic Tinkerer **You are listening to an excerpt from _Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc_ (2016), scroll down to switch it off. **
I was born in the green and leafy outer-eastern suburbs of Melbourne in 1985, and spent my early years in the middle of alpine forest in north-east Victoria. Now I spend my time as a composer: a tinkerer with acoustic and electronic sound in the context of concert music, electronic music, installation, and performance.</description>

Monash University Flute Ensemble: Fantasie Australis (CD)
Two of my works: Fantasie Australis and Fragments appear on this newly released CD from Move Records. I think this is an amazing achievement and the result is superb. It&amp;rsquo;s a very fine CD and there is some great playing on it! Many thanks to Peter and the MUFE.</description>

      <description>Press » Vincent Giles Long Bio (~700 words, first person) I was born in the green and leafy outer-eastern suburbs of Melbourne in 1985, and spent my early years in the middle of alpine forest in north-east Victoria. Now I spend my time as a composer: a tinkerer with acoustic and electronic sound in the context of concert music, electronic music, installation, and performance. Whatever form my work takes, it is usually influenced by the natural world, science and mathematics, and self-imposed compositional limitations; I see music as a type of perception and manifestation of already-existent natural phenomena and relationships, in the same way that mathematics is a notation of natural relationships and so attempt to express the most elegant form of the observed relationships.</description>
