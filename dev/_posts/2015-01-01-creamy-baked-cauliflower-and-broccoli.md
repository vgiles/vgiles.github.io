Doing roasts without meat is a pretty fun challenge. The best part, I
find, asides the awesome array of flavour, is the complete lack of
preparation time and cleaning that is required. I remember in the
periods where I've eaten meat (between not), the pre-time for roasting
meat is much greater than for vegetables.

So when doing roasts, as I did this evening, finding a fun new
centrepiece or side to take the place of the roast meat really presents
some fun cooking opportunities. This recipe was served with:

-   potatoes & parsnip roasted in olive oil, garlic, onion, rosemary,
    and black pepper;
-   zucchini, carrots, green capsicum, roasted in canola oil, white
    pepper, dried oregano.

So on to the recipe.

Creamy Sauce
------------

### Ingredients

-   1.5 tbsp tahini paste
-   0.5 tbsp margarine (I use the ALDI brand, because it's cheap, but
    Nutalex is always good)
-   1.0 cloves garlic
-   1.0 tsp English mustard
-   Water to thin

### Method

1.  Melt the margarine with loosely chopped garlic, in microwave (I used
    a mug)
2.  Add tahini & mustard and stir
3.  Add water until a creamy consistency equaling around about 1.2 cups
    is reached.

Cauli & Broc & Whatnot
----------------------

### Ingredients

-   1/2 head of cauliflower, chopped into whatever sized chunks you want
-   1 head of broccoli, chopped into whatever sized chunks you want
-   Fresh basil, about a cup worth
-   2 tomatoes, chopped into 8ths
-   White pepper

### Method

1.  Put chopped cauli and broc into a baking dish
2.  Add basil and tomatoes
3.  Top with white pepper to your taste
4.  Pour over the creamy sauce.
5.  Cover with foil (or a lid if using a lidded baking dish)
6.  Bake at 180C (Fan Forced) for about 30-40 mins, then an additional
    10-20 mins without the lid.

Sorry I forgot to take a photo. It looked like it sounds like it would
look.
