  You have to start somewhere, right?
</p>
<p>
  I did not really want to cook anything tonight, but got inspired by a story about the onion (which was pretty mediocre really) on some news website (either The Guardian or The Age), which in itself is unremarkable, but it made me consider what I could do with the abundance of red onions that my partner and I bought from the market the other day.
</p>
<p>
  This post will also serve as somewhat of an introduction to what this blog is, or will be, if I manage to keep it up.
</p>
<p>
  You see, I am terrible at noting down nice recipes that I come up with. So this serves as my own personal "recipe book", if you like. But I figure that other people might also like them. The difference – I hope – between this and other food blogs is that I will be using this to document the development of recipes, somewhat like the development of music scores, from an early version (0.1) through to a finished version (1.0), and possibly beyond. I have a suspicion that many will stay at 0.1. However! There is an opportunity here for other people to join in the experimentation and suggest changes/etc. So I liken it to "experimental music", where the outcome is potentially unknown (though sometimes anticipated), and may not actually work.
</p>
<p>
  So that's the idea. Now for the first recipe. Remember, this was made up 20 minutes ago, and I have no idea how it tastes.

<h1>Onion, Eggplant, &amp; Tomato Savoury Tart (v. 0.2)</h1>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
  <li>1.2x sheets of shortcrust pastry (vegan, in my case) [the remaining 0.8 will be used in another recipe]</li>
  <li>3x medium-large red onions</li>
  <li>1.5x large tomatoes</li>
  <li>0.5x medium-large aubergine/eggplant (split lengthways)</li>
  <li>~7 oyster mushrooms</li>
  <li>Cracked black pepper</li>
  <li>Ground white pepper</li>
  <li>Salt</li>
  <li>Asafoetida</li>
  <li>Olive oil</li>
  <li>Dried basil</li>
  <li>About 10 dry bay leaves</li>
  <li>Spray oil for tart tray (I used canola)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Method</h3>
<ol>
  <li>If using frozen pastry, thaw it. Preheat oven to 180C (fan-forced).</li>
  <li>Top and tail the three onions, cut them in half, then slice them. Keep it reasonably rough.</li>
  <li>With the half eggplant, slice it in half length ways, repeat, and repeat again (for each quarter), then chop the small wedges in half sideways to get ~3-4cm length wedges.</li>
  <li>Spray a tart tray/shallow pie dish with oil. Lay the 1.2 sheets of pastry as necessary to fill the dish and neaten the edges if necessary/use the excess to complete the edges too.</li>
  <li>Grind some black pepper all over the pastry.</li>
  <li>Add the onions in one large layer, remember that they will reduce substantially with cooking.</li>
  <li>Add eggplant wedges in slightly layered circle around the outer edge of the onions. Sprinkle salt over the wedges, then drizzle olive oil on top of that.</li>
  <li>Trim the stalks off the oyster mushrooms and place them in the centre, and with any extra mushrooms cut them in half and place them every 2-3 wedges of eggplant.</li>
  <li>Chop the tomatoes in thin slices. Place on top of the wedges, close-ish together, and then one or two slices in the centre.</li>
  <li>Cover with white pepper, basil, asafoetida, and some more olive oil, and wedge bay leaves in/on the top layer.</li>
  <li>Place in the oven uncovered and bake for about 80 minutes, making sure that the eggplant is cooked (use your eyes and/or a skewer)</li>
  <li>Serve with a side of rocket/roquette lettuce, with a drizzle of lime juice, and a few slivers of avocado. I don't roquette available tonight, so it will likely be a mixed-cabbage and carrot dry slaw, with avocado.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Slaw Side</h2>
<p>
  Given that my avocados were bad, and I lacked roquette, I made this slaw in place.
</p>

<h3>Ingredients/method</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Red cabbage, green cabbage, carrot: all grated, not too much as it's a side.</li>
  <li>A squeeze of lemon juice, some ground black pepper and salt, hand mixed and served on the side.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Verdict</h3>
<p>
  Really, really damn good.
