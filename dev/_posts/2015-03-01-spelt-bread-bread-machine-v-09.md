This is almost ready for version 1.0, but still could be better. Some
minor variations of mine to this
recipe:Â <http://www.food.com/recipe/perfect-bread-machine-spelt-bread-298300>,
so all credit to this for the base. I've never been able to get a fluffy
loaf like they describe, but I'm working on improving it.

The first thing I noticed was all the talk about spelt flour having a
different gluten structure to wheat, and so I thought that perhaps using
a gluten substitute to help might work. It did. My next step was
attempting to get a bit more moisture and a bit more lift out of the
yeast. Definitely getting there.

Spelt Bread - Bread Machine (V0.9)
==================================

### Ingredients

4 cups spelt flour (either wholemeal or white, organic or not. I've been
using organic white)

1.5 cups of tepid water

3.5 tsp dried yeast

6 tsp of raw dark sugar

2 tsp of salt

3 tbsp olive oil

1.5 tsp xanthan gum

### Method

1.  Put water into bread machine, followed by sugar. Give it a stir to
    part-dissolve. Add yeast. Then leisurely add the remaining
    ingredients in no particular order.
2.  Set bread machine to medium size, light crust, default (white bread)
    setting. Should be about 3h12-20 minutes.

Bonza.
