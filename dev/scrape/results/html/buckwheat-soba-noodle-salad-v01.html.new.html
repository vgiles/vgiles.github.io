<h1>Buckwheat Soba Noodle Salad (V.0.2)</h1>
<p>
  This thing was inspired by the salad with the same title that Disco Beans in Preston (Melb, Vic) have on their menu at the moment. I am seriously considering doing their cooking class to learn how to make at least the dressing that comes with it. But I thought this would be a pretty tasty lunch on a fairly warm day.
</p>
<p>
  My partner thinks it was too fatty tasting and too strong on the olive oil, but I disagree on both counts. However, if you decide to make it, keep that in mind. In future, I would add some seaweed and avocado, and possibly a sprinkling of crushed chilli on top.
</p>
<p>
  Revision two modifies the dressing a little, and includes avocado and alternative leafy greens.

<h3>Salad Ingredients</h3>

<p>
  You could use whatever you want, really. But I used:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>5-10 cherry tomatoes, quartered.</li>
  <li>The entirety of the inner heart of an iceberg lettuce, loosely chopped OR;</li>
  <li>Two big handfuls of mixed greens, OR;</li>
  <li>Two big handfuls of baby spinach</li>
  <li>1/2 a lebanese cucumber, cut lengthways into small lengths.</li>
  <li>1/2 a zucchini grated</li>
  <li>1 bunch (about 8-9) spring onions, chopped</li>
  <li>1 large avocado, cubed</li>
  <li>1 tube of Chinese buckwheat soba noodles (dried, boiled for five minutes, strained, washed with cold water, and left to cool). These have wheat in them.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Dressing</h3>
<ul>
  <li>1/3 cup of extra virgin olive oil</li>
  <li>1 tbsp of sesame oil</li>
  <li>1 tbsp of black sesame seeds</li>
  <li>1/3 cup of soy sauce</li>
  <li>1 heaped tsp of white miso paste (optional)</li>
  <li>1 tsp of vegan "fish" sauce (made with pineapple juice)</li>
  <li>2 basically juiceless limes, but would use 1 juicy one.</li>
  <li>1 tbsp lemon juice</li>
  <li>1/3 cup of rice wine vinegar</li>
  <li>1 tbsp of tepid, brewed, black tea.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Whisk that all together, assemble salad and toss, pour on the dressing, toss again (I used hands!) and serve.
</p>

<p>
  Needs revision, but it was really good.
