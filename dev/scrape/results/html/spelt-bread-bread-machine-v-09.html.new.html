  This is almost ready for version 1.0, but still could be better. Some minor variations of mine to this recipe:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.food.com/recipe/perfect-bread-machine-spelt-bread-298300">http://www.food.com/recipe/perfect-bread-machine-spelt-bread-298300</a>, so all credit to this for the base. I've never been able to get a fluffy loaf like they describe, but I'm working on improving it.

  The first thing I noticed was all the talk about spelt flour having a different gluten structure to wheat, and so I thought that perhaps using a gluten substitute to help might work. It did. My next step was attempting to get a bit more moisture and a bit more lift out of the yeast. Definitely getting there.

</ul>
<li>4 cups spelt flour (either wholemeal or white, organic or not. I've been using organic white)</li>

<li>6 tsp of raw dark sugar</li>
<li>2 tsp of salt</li>
<li>3 tbsp olive oil</li>
<li>1.5 tsp xanthan gum</li>

<h3>Method</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Put water into bread machine, followed by sugar. Give it a stir to part-dissolve. Add yeast. Then leisurely add the remaining ingredients in no particular order.</li>
  <li>Set bread machine to medium size, light crust, default (white bread) setting. Should be about 3h12-20 minutes.</li>
</ol>

<p>
  Bonza.
