#### Artist Statement
I believe that an artist should reject the ego and the self as part of the making process (and in life), so as to not let them interfere by imposing concepts such as taste or style upon the work. An artist should reject sentimentality, catharsis, and other ‘expressive’ reasons for making, and by doing so, focus on relating art to non-subjective reality and to the every-day; the banal. I believe in taking the entire spectrum of sound, audible and inaudible, as the basis of music and that music is organised sound. In this I agree with Varèse, Cage, and others, and want sound to be itself, organised by a human, or not. In this making, one should be experimental, always, and document one’s work as much as is practical. An artist’s work is created for the medium, and transcription from one medium to another is not the business of the artist; make something for the other medium that is new to you instead. In this endeavour one must find something to devote oneself to and do it. One must make for the sake of making and find something to do. Reject ignorance and be informed, of the field and of the world.

    <td width="33%">People talk of music as this great communicative medium: often this is strongly tied to the ego and the self (self-expression, for example), and what people tend to mean by this is sentimentality, catharsis, and emotions, and the communication of these things to anybody who’ll listen. That is: expressing one’s feelings through some artistic medium in the hope that somebody else listens to it and understands the message, or at least maps their own lived experiences onto the music. The mapping will happen anyway, so why force your own shit down peoples’ throats? At best that is rude, and at worst, it is dogmatic, reminding me of being preached at on street corners. Rather, these things – sentimentality, catharsis, expressive intentions – can be catalysts for art if they must be but if music is communicative, then one must naturally ask what is being communicated, and how? Communication is “the imparting or exchanging of information by speaking, writing, or using some other medium” which seems woefully inadequate to the social, cognitive, and other experiences that music (and art)does offer. Art is not a tool for an artist to ‘communicate’ to the world, like some kind of amplifier, but rather a mode of experiencing the world, which is a very different consideration that has nothing to do with an artist’s sentimentality, catharsis, or other ‘expression’ that relies on the self or the ego.</td>

And: "Following from this, a focus on systems and a certain precision in the construction of a work, or, more importantly, carefully controlling the location and extent of human, composerly intervention & decision- making." And: "experiments in the arts seem to negate the possibility of revision, as such." This very much follows in the tradition of Cage, who discusses composition as process (as opposed to music as process), and the removal of the composer’s ego, taste, stylistic tastes, and so forth through the primacy of (non-banal) questions instead of answers or stylistic dogma, defined by the artist or by the lineage and cannon. As Cage has pointed out (and as is echoed by Cassidy), it is desirable that composition (and listening) is a process of discovery, of expanding listening, and to be experimental is to be true and authentic to this ideal.</td>
