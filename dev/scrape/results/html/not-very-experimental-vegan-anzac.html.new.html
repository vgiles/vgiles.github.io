  This little recipe has been in development for a while now, and is also the first v.1.0 recipe I've posted.
</p>
<p>
  I really need to emphasise that I have borrowed most of the recipe from <a href="http://www.veganeasy.org/S-Anzac-Biscuits" target="_blank">VeganEasy.org, the recipe is by Jo.</a>&nbsp;However, I have modified it to suit my own taste and cooking style, so I am including my version here. This version is much, much less sweet than the original, but likely more crumbly (which I like).

<h1>Not Very Experimental Vegan Anzac Biscuits (V.1.0)</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Preheat oven to 180C (FF).</li>
  <li>1 cup of oats</li>
  <li>1 cup of self-raising flour, gluten free</li>
  <li>1 cup of desiccated coconut (or shredded, but des. works better)</li>
  <li>1/2 cup of soft brown sugar</li>
  <li>2/3 cup of liquid coconut oil</li>
  <li>1 tsp of warm/hot water</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Combine all the ingredients in a mixing bowl and then form into biscuits (squish into walnut sized balls, then flatten slightly), place onto a baking-paper-lined-baking-tray, and bake at 180C for about 25 minutes or until you think they are suitably baked.

  Enjoy.
