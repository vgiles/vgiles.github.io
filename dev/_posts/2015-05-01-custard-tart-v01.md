Hello,

Today I am in the process of making an experimental custard tart.
Experimental because I have absolutely no idea if it will work, or how
good it will be. Completely untested! The stakes? A dinner party!

Verdict: freaking delicious.

### Ingredients

#### Base

-   1 packet of Arnotts "Nice" biscuits (they're vegan!)
-   \~1/3 cup of raw cashews
-   \~1/3 cup melted coconut oil
-   \~2 tbsp homemade peanut butter ([link to
    recipe](peanut-butter-v01.html))

#### Custard

-   2 cans of coconut milk
-   \~3 tsp vanilla essence
-   \~3/4 cup raw, dark brown sugar
-   \~7 tbsp tapioca starch
-   \~2 tsp nutmeg

### Method:

#### Base

Blend all the ingredients other than the oil and peanut butter until
powdery. Transfer to a mixing bowl, add oil and peanut butter and
combine into a loose base. Transfer to an oiled pie dish, pack it firmly
into the bottom and the edges, and bake at about 200C for about 15
minutes to make it nice and firm.

#### Custard

Put all ingredients in blender and blend until smooth. Transfer to large
pot and cook on medium heat, stirring/whisking constantly, until
custard-like consistency is reached. Transfer to pie dish, sprinkle some
additional nutmeg or cinnamon on the top.

Allow entire tart to cool, then place in fridge until serving time.
