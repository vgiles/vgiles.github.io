  No photo, unfortunately, but I made this creamy salad dressing to go with a mock-chicken salad. I suspect it would also go exceptionally well with either pasta or potato salad.

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Tahini paste</li>
  <li>Extra virgin olive oil</li>
  <li>Nutritional yeast flakes</li>
  <li>Salt</li>
  <li>Apple cider vinegar</li>
  <li>Dried marjoram</li>
</ul>

<h3>Method</h3>
<ol>
  <li>In a little jar with a tight-fitting lid, add the ingredients roughly as follows:</li>
  <li>1:2:2 ratio between tahini:olive oil:vinegar</li>
  <li>Pinch of salt</li>
  <li>Two tsp of yeast flakes (depending on quantity of dressing)</li>
  <li>Marjoram as desired (I used about a tsp)</li>
  <li>Then put the lid on tight and shake the hell out of it until it's all smooth and creamy, adjusting the quantity of oil as necessary for more smoothness.</li>
</ol>
