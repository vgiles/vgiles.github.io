  <div class="post-content">
    <p>I went out for dinner last night with my partner and some old school
friends (and SOs) to an Indian restaurant in Melbourne called Gaylords.
It was exquisite, though I somehow ended up with an <em>extra-</em>hot
vegetarian Vindaloo. It didn’t list that it included paneer, which was
annoying, but it did, so it was not vegan. But it was exquisite. It
inspired me to make a vindaloo of my own. I’ve used other people’s
recipes, or book recipes, for years now, but I’ve not tackled a vegan
vindaloo yet. To be fair, I’m not entirely convinced it should be called
a vindaloo, though of course there is so much variety in these curries
that it probably doesn’t matter. Anyway… for the base of this recipe I
used Madhur Jaffrey’s Goan Pork Vindaloo recipe (from her <em>Quick &amp; Easy
Indian Cooking,</em> which is written for a pressure cooker, which I don’t
have!)</p>

<p>I’ve not tried the original recipe, but it served as a decent basis to
build mine off. So I want to acknowledge that source material.</p>

<p>This recipe also differs from, as far as I can tell, a lot of Indian
cooking because it is baked in a cast-iron pot (pot-roasted?) rather
than cooked on a stove, or a pressure cooker. Also note that this is a
recipe designed for bulk cooking so that my partner and I can take food
to work with us over the coming days.</p>

<h3 id="general-ingredients">General ingredients:</h3>

<p>1x large potato + 2x medium potatoes, loosely cubed in various sizes</p>

<p>550g firm tofu, cubed</p>

<p>~2-3 cups of (soaked/cooked) chickpeas. I used dried, which soaked for
about 12 hours.</p>

<p>Couple of handfuls of green beans, with ends removed.</p>

<p>1 tin of whole tomatoes</p>

<p>1 tin of coconut milk</p>

<p>1-2 tbsp of coconut oil</p>

<h3 id="curry-paste-ingredients--method">Curry paste ingredients &amp; method:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>1.5 tbsp brown mustard seeds</li>
  <li>1.5 tbsp yellow mustard seeds</li>
  <li>3 tbsp apple cider vinegar + more as needed (I used white as I ran
out of AC)</li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>Using a large mortar and pestle, grind the mustard seeds and
vinegar into a paste that still has quite a bit of texture.</li>
</ol>

<p>To this paste, add:</p>

<p>~12 large cloves of garlic</p>

<p>~1 medium red onions, loosely chopped</p>

<p>3 heaped tsp of ground turmeric</p>

<p>3 heaped tsp of ground coriander seed</p>

<p>3 heaped tsp of ground cumin seed</p>

<p>3 heaped tsp of cayenne pepper</p>

<p>3 dried kashmiri chilis</p>

<p>~1 tsp of asafoetida powder</p>

<p>2 level tsp of salt</p>

<p>~9-15 dried curry leaves</p>

<p>~3 tbsp of red wine vinegar</p>

<ol>
  <li>Pulverise until a chunky paste consistency is achieved.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="method">Method:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Preheat oven to 160C (fan forced), with large cast-iron pot (with
lid) inside</li>
  <li>In a separate frying pan, heat on a hot heat the coconut oil.</li>
  <li>Once hot, add about 1/3 of the curry paste and fry until fragrant</li>
  <li>
    <p>Add the cubed tofu and fry until it starts to absorb the colour of
the paste</p>
  </li>
  <li>Remove hot pot from oven, transfer contents from frying pan to pot</li>
  <li>Add the remaining paste and fresh ingredients</li>
  <li>Add tomatoes including juice, then use scissors to chop them up</li>
  <li>Add coconut milk and about 1/2 a tin of extra water</li>
  <li>Put the lid on and put it in the oven for about an hour and a half,
stirring every 30 or so minutes.</li>
  <li>Once the hour and a half is up (or the potatoes/chickpeas are nearly
cooked through), turn the oven up to 200C (fan-forced) and cook for
a further 30-40 minutes until well-reduced and a thick, clinging
gravy exists and the tomatoes have basically turned to liquid. Sauce
should be a dark caramel colour by this stage.</li>
  <li>Serve with basmati rice or whatever you want.</li>
</ul>
