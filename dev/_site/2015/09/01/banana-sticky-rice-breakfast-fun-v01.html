    <p>Good morning.</p>

<p>I think this post will be the first time I’ve made an experimental
breakfast, possibly ever, but definitely in a long time. Certainly the
first I’ll have written up a recipe for.</p>

<p>We accidentally put too much sticky rice on to soak a few nights ago, so
have been thinking of ways to eat it. It’s pretty good stuff; a staple
of Northern Thailand (Isaan, if I remember correctly), but also used in
other south-east and east-Asian cooking: desserts, in particular.</p>

<p>This recipe is tasty, though takes a little getting used to, especially
not long after waking up. I think I will revise it over time (as is
intended with all these recipes not marked v.1), but would love it if
other people also modified it and told me about their results.</p>

<h3 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h3>

<ul>
  <li>~2 cups of (white) sticky rice, soaked overnight.</li>
  <li>~1 banana</li>
  <li>~2 tsp tahini paste</li>
  <li>~2 tsp coconut cream</li>
  <li>~2 tsp maple syrup</li>
  <li>cinnamon</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="method">Method:</h3>

<p>For the sticky rice, I use a rice cooker with steamer basket on top,
lined with aluminium foil with holes stabbed into it. I put the sticky
rice in the steamer on top of the foil, make sure the rice cooker bowl
has plenty of water in it, cover, and steam until cooked. It takes about
15-35 minutes, depending on how soaked the rice is. You can get away
with soaking only for a couple of hours, but the cook time is longer and
the results can be a bit variable.</p>

<p>To make the sauce, just put the tahini, coconut cream and maple syrup
into a bowl and mix it well. Adjust quantities for flavour preferences.
This quantity of maple syrup is not overly sweet, in fact the sauce
tastes decidedly like Halva.</p>

<p>Once the rice is cooked, place however much you want on a serving thing,
chop a banana over the top, sprinkle with cinnamon (I’m not sure the
cinnamon is the greatest addition to the recipe; might try LSA or
similar next time), and then pour/dollop the tahini sauce over the top.</p>

<p>Nom with fingers if you’re feeling messy, I used a spoon so I could
civilly drink a coffee at the same time.</p>
