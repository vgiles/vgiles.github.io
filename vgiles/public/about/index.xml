      <description>Vincent Giles Â» Composer &amp;amp; Sonic Tinkerer **You are listening to an excerpt from _Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc_ (2016), scroll down to switch it off. **
I was born in the green and leafy outer-eastern suburbs of Melbourne in 1985, and spent my early years in the middle of alpine forest in north-east Victoria. Now I spend my time as a composer: a tinkerer with acoustic and electronic sound in the context of concert music, electronic music, installation, and performance.</description>
